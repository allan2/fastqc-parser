# FastQC Reports

An aggregator for FastQC sequence data reports.

This program summarizes many reports from [FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC) together.

No longer will you have open separate files and flipping through them all to check your sequence data quality.
View hundreds of plots in a grid in a single HTML file!

Example:
```sh
fastqc_reports -i input_dir -o aggregate_report.html
```
